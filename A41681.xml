         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHatever fals under the Law of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">The Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic.</note> is thereby limited and confined: and by how much the more excellent and perfect the thing is, by ſo much the greater is its <hi>Vitioſitie</hi> and <hi>Vanitie,</hi> if it excede its juſt limits: For <hi>the corruption of the beſt things is ever worſt.</hi> This is in nothing more evident than in Philoſophie, which in its original and primitive Idea was moſt Auguſt and Glorioſe: but now, alas! alas! what an inane, confuſed, ſterile thing is it! How difficult is it to ſeparate any regular Uſe from the Abuſe thereof! The Deſigne of this following Diſcourſe is to explicate, and demonſtrate the prodigioſe Abuſes, which Philoſophie, by reaſon of the <hi>Vanitie, Errors,</hi> and <hi>Prejudices</hi> of mans corrupt mind, has been obnoxious unto; whereof we have prefixed an Introductorie Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viarie in our Preface to the ſecond Part, as alſo in the Contents of this third; ſo that we ſhal not need to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face any thing farther hereof. That which we have now under Contemplation is a Proemial account of the grand <hi>Deſigne, Moment,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of this Third Part, touching the <hi>VANITIE OF PAGAN PHILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHIE,</hi> in order to a ſeparation of its <hi>Abuſe</hi> from the regular <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>grand Deſigne</hi> of this Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">The Deſigne of this Diſcourſe.</note> we muſt ingenuoſly confeſſe, it gave us ſome of the firſt and principal Ideas and Impreſſions of al our Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Reformation of Philoſophie. For after long Obſervation and Inquiſition made into the many prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioſe
<pb facs="tcp:101821:3"/>Errors, and grand Apoſtaſies of the Church in al Ages, ſpecially under Antichriſt, we find that <hi>Vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie</hi> lies as a latent root, and conceled ſpring of this <hi>Myſterie of Iniquitie.</hi> Whence ſpringes al Apoſtaſie in Profeſſion, but from ſome degree of Apoſtaſie in Light and Affection? As God's departure from Churches is gradual, ſo the departure of Churches from God: And what are the firſt ſteps of departing from God, but when the Love of God and his Evangelie Truths is ſhut out of the heart? Is there not a ſtrange Infatuation and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſe ſtupiditie in the leaſt degree of backſliding from the love of the Truth and its ſimplicitie? And was not this that which gave the firſt lines to the formation of that <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and his Antichriſtian Apoſtaſie? This the Spirit of God aſſures us of,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.10, 11.</note> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling, <hi>[That the Man of Sin ſhould come] with al deceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe; becauſe they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved. And for this cauſe God ſhal ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie.</hi> The whole ſtreſſe of this Antichriſtian Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie ſeems to be laid on this, that <hi>men received not the love of the Truth;</hi> or the Truth in the love thereof. This was that maligne worme that lay at the root of the heart, which cauſed a vital decay in Chriſtianitie, and ſo laid the foundation of that great Antichriſtian Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, even in thoſe Primitive Churches. As in Nature al withering begins at the root, though it firſt appear in the branches; ſo in al Apoſtaſie, the conſumtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins firſt at the heart. And whence proceded this vital conſumtion at the heart of the firſt Chriſtians and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but from want of love to Evangelic Truth, and its ſimplicitie? Was it not hence that many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſpecially <hi>Origen,</hi> and ſuch as were educated in the Schole at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> labored under a libidinoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable thirſt after Vain Philoſophie; vainly hoping
<pb facs="tcp:101821:3"/>thereby to beautifie and adorne Chriſtian Theologie? But did they really attain their End? was not the whole Syſteme of Antichriſtian <hi>Errors, Apoſtaſies,</hi> and <hi>Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> introduced hereby? This we have copioſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, <hi>Book II.</hi> of this Third Part.</p>
            <p>If it be further inquired, how it comes to paſſe,<note place="margin">The malignitie of Pagan Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie.</note> that Pagan Philoſophie, which containes in it ſo many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Philoſophemes and Contemplations, ſhould have ſuch a venimous influence on the worſt of Errors and Apoſtaſies? That which ſatisfies mine own Inquiſition herein may be reduced to theſe three Heads:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> As conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it ſelf.</note> (1) The <hi>Vanitie</hi> and <hi>Malignitie of the Object.</hi> (2) <hi>The Vanitie</hi> and <hi>Malignitie of the Subject.</hi> (3) <hi>The Curſe of God on both.</hi> 1. The <hi>Object, Pagan Philoſophie,</hi> conſidered in it ſelf, containes in it much of <hi>Vanitie</hi> and <hi>Malignitie.</hi> This we have ſufficiently demonſtrated, <hi>B.</hi> 1. throughout, from the <hi>Cauſes, Parts,</hi> and <hi>Adjuncts of Pagan Philoſophie.</hi> But that wherein the Spirit of its malignitie ſeems to conſiſte is not ſo much its <hi>Mater, Parts, Adjuncts,</hi> or <hi>effective ſprings,</hi> as its principal End and Deſigne, which is to reduce and advance lapſed man to a ſtate of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie and Perfection, by the force and improvement of his own Free-wil. The grand Deſigne of <hi>Ethnic</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, in its original conſtitution, was to put men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Covenant of Workes, thereby to keep them from Sin, and to merit Life. Proud nature ever affectes an Independence as to God, and to procure a Divine life by its own forces: What more pleaſing to corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than to act from, and for it ſelf? O! how fruitful is the root of the Old Covenant in corrupt nature! How apt is every man by nature to run himſelf on a Covenant of Workes, and deifie ſome righteouſneſſe of his own, though never ſo unrighteous! What latent venes of <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> are there in the hearts of al by nature! whence, according to <hi>Augustin, Pelagianiſme is
<pb facs="tcp:101821:4"/>the Hereſie of Nature.</hi> Now what was the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>prime Error</hi> of al <hi>Ethnic</hi> Philoſophie but this, ſo to <hi>cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate, refine</hi> and <hi>elevate</hi> corrupt nature, as to render it a ſit Temple of the Deitie, without the ſuperaddition of Medicinal Grace? It's true, that <hi>Socratic</hi> and <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic</hi> Philoſophie ſpeakes much of <hi>the Divine Infuſion of Virtue;</hi> yet ſtil as the reward of mens endeavors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt regard to the New Covenant or true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But yet the principal poiſon and malignitie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Philoſophie aroſe from the Spirits and Principes of thoſe who compoſed the ſame,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> As to its Subject.</note> or were converſant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Had Philoſophie been never ſo pure and virgin in it ſelf, yet falling on carnal, proud, and wanton wits, how ſoon was it adulterated and rendred vain, yea no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious! We ſee, by ſad experience, how ſoon the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of our Lord, and Evangelic Dogmes are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the greateſt Errors, when men of corrupt minds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage therein. How much more then was Philoſophie, in it ſelf ſo corrupt, obnoxious to Vanitie and corruption, when the minds of men engaged therein were ſo vain and corrupt! Thus much the Scripture takes notice of, touching the Philoſophers,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. <hi>But became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh hearts were dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened.</hi> The natural imagination is the moſt vain thing in the world: how doth it like the ſilke-worme, lie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in thoſe Philoſophemes, which came out of its own bowels! How ſoon did luſt in thoſe blind Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, put out the light of Reaſon, and ſo darken their fooliſh hearts!<note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> Hence it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wiſe</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> great <hi>Sophiſtes</hi>] <hi>they became fools.</hi> There is nothing more worthy of compaſſion, than the blindneſſe of ſuch proud Sophiſtes, who profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the moſt quick-ſighted and ſage in the world. Is not the terrible peſtiferous darkeneſſe of ſuch, by ſo much the
<pb facs="tcp:101821:4"/>more deplorable, in that they take it for Light, which they follow with pleaſure, as Children do the <hi>Ignis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus,</hi> which leades them to precipices and ruine? Are not ſuch greatly to be pitied, who uſe their Reaſon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to render them more unreaſonable? And has not this been a principal cauſe of the Vanitie of Philoſophie, and its peſtiferous influences on al great Apoſtaſies?</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may adde hereto the <hi>Curſe</hi> of God on Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie and Philoſophers,<note place="margin">

            <p>Neither hath this Judiciary curſe terminated only on Pagan Philoſophie, but alſo diffuſed it ſelf through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out almoſt the whole of Scholaſtic Theologie. Yea, I muſt confeſſe my ſelf to be in this point of the ſame perſuaſion with pious <hi>Janſenius,</hi> that great Patron of Medicinal Grace, who, in his <hi>Auguſt.

And a great Prelat of this Age and Nation aſſures us, <hi>That there hath not been a greater plague to Chriſtian Religion than Schole-Divinitie.</hi> And he gives this reaſon of it: <q rend="inline"> When men wil be wiſer than God, and thinke by their fooliſh wiſdome to adde to Gods Word; God, to convince them of their folie, ſuffers Satan to ſow ſeeds of Hereſie and Diviſion among them.</q> Such is the vanitie and malignitie of Philoſophie, and al hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:101821:6"/>wiſdome, when abuſed by men of reprobate minds, and ſo brought under a Divine Curſe.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſee how neceſſary it is for any,<note place="margin">The right uſe of Philoſophie.</note> that wil make a right uſe of Philoſophie, to ſeparate therefrom its vanitie and abuſes: and how can this be duely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but by a curioſe Contemplation of, and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition into the <hi>Cauſes, Adjuncts,</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie; which is the principal Intendement of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe. And if we wil indeed render Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie uſeful we muſt obſerve theſe general Rules: (1) <hi>That al Philoſophie be reduced,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See more of theſe Rules Philoſ. Genera. Diſſer. Prooem. p. <hi>7,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>to and meaſured by its original and perfect Exemplar, the Divine Word and Light.</hi> Had the firſt Fathers, <hi>Origen, &amp;c.</hi> as alſo the Scholaſtic Theologues, their Succeſſors, taken this courſe, what great uſe might they have made of <hi>Ethnic</hi> Philoſophie, and preſerved the Church from thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroſe Errors, and Abuſes that followed the ſame? (2) <hi>That ſo much only of Pagan Philoſophie muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as may ſubſerve Chriſtian Theologie, not oppoſe the ſame.</hi> (3) <hi>That not the end of Ethnic Philoſophie, or Philoſophers, may be aſſumed by us, but only ſuch Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes as may ſerve to explicate Dogmes in Theologie.</hi> The End both of Pagan Philoſophie and Philoſophers, being to exalt the <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Heats,</hi> or <hi>Forces</hi> of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and to reduce men to the old antiquated Covenant of Workes, this may in no regard be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſtians, who are under a New Covenant: yet there are many excellent Philoſophemes and Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both Moral and Metaphyſic, which if improved by an humble fidele mind, on Evangelic Principes and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiyes, may be of great uſe, not only for the Moraliſing of Perſons and Republics, but alſo for the Explication of many momentoſe Verities in Chriſtian Theologie. Hereof we have given many Specimens in our Fourth
<pb facs="tcp:101821:6"/>Part of the <hi>Court of the Gentiles,</hi> as alſo in our <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia Generalis, Part</hi> 1. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3, 4. and <hi>Part</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>We are alſo to premit ſomething touching the <hi>Forme</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of this following Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">The Forme of this Diſcourſe.</note> which we have endeavored to ſuit to our Mater, as Nature doth her Formes. And whereas we have explicated and inſiſted on ſo many Textes of Scripture, we preſume that wil not be thought impertinent, ſithat our main ſubject is the <hi>Vanitie</hi> and <hi>Abuſes</hi> of Philoſophie, which are beſt evidenced by <hi>Divine Light.</hi> We may not alſo pretermit without ſome mention the many Citations and Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made uſe of by us out of <hi>Grotius;</hi> whoſe Annotations and Illuſtrations we have frequently cited; not as if we eſtimed him an authentic Judge in maters of Faith or Scripture; but as he was a good Critic, wel-skilled in Antiquitie, and a perſon of great eſtime for his Learning; ſo that it cannot be conceived, that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt Pagan Philoſophie ſhould procede from any groundleſſe prejudice againſt the ſame, but rather from a juſt and deſerved apprehenſion of the many evils and peſtiferous effects that attended the abuſe thereof. I muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe, that when I did read <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Annotations on the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diligently obſerved, how much he decried vain Philoſophie, by reaſon of its noxious Infuſions, and venimous influences on the principal Errors in the Chriſtian Church, it put me on more curioſe Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diligent reſearches into this mater: wherein I found the Abuſes of Philoſophie much greater than ever I imagined.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf, if it may not ſeem too great preſumtion to give the world my Character of ſo Learned a man, I conceive he did the Church and
<pb facs="tcp:101821:7"/>Learned men good ſervice, before he, by reaſon of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or Diſcontent, fel off to <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> and <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandrian Poperie,</hi> which his Controverſies with <hi>Rivet</hi> demonſtrate him greatly propenſe unto. And to make good this my Charge, I ſhal give a Specimen of ſome <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Errors, which lie ſcattered in his Annotations on the New Teſtament. On <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.58. he renders <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     <hi>Natural Theologie,</hi> there was none more famoſe than that of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> which came the neareſt of any to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Theologie,</hi> and yet was nevertheleſſe corrupt. Yea indeed there ſeems to be this peculiar curſe on the <hi>Pythagorean Natural Theologie,</hi> that though it came the neareſt of any to <hi>Divine Theologie,</hi> yet was it the moſt corrupt of al both in it ſelf, as alſo in its effects. For none more devoted to Superſtition and <hi>Idolatrie</hi> than the <hi>Pythagoreans;</hi> none greater <hi>Hereſiarches,</hi> or founders of Hereſie in the Chriſtian Church than they. This we may look upon as procedeing from a particular curſe of God

This has been excellently opened to us by <hi>Owen, Theolog. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. where having laid open the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of the new <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> after the breaking forth of the Goſpel to reforme Philoſophie, ſo as to make it a Vicarious <hi>Natural Theologie,</hi> he addes the ſame of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie: <q rend="inline">Al that ancient Wiſdome (ſaith he) of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> conſiſted in a way for the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> I confeſſe the whole of that <hi>Philoſophie</hi> ſavored of <hi>Idolatrie ſuperſtition;</hi> which yet retained ſome obſcure Images and Characters of the Truth.

Whence theſe blind Philoſophers (who traded in Oriental <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Traditions) were mighty greedy in catching after every <hi>ſenſible forme, corporal image</hi> or ſhadow, whereby Divine Truths were ſet forth: wherein none abounded more than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which was the chief ſeat of al Symbolic Wiſdome. Hence therefore thoſe <hi>Grecians</hi> derived either immediately or mediately the chief of their <hi>Symbolic learning,</hi> both as to <hi>mater</hi> and <hi>forme:</hi> But not underſtanding the true mind and ſcope of theſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Symbolic Myſteries, they at firſt amuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in contemplating the ſhel, cabinet, or bone only, without ever attaining unto the kernel, jewel, or marrow of Divine Truths. Thence having ſatiated their phantaſies, and glutted their curioſitie in their dreaming contemplations of thoſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Symbols, without any real notion of thoſe Truths which were

                  <p>To give check and confuſion to theſe proud ſentiments of that <hi>Pelagian</hi> Antichriſtian party God raiſed up <hi>Auguſtin</hi> for the ſuccur of his poor bleeding Church,<note place="margin">Auguſtin's Zele againſt Pelagianiſme.</note> againſt the moſt peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Hereſie that ever infeſted it. He was a perſon of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioſe natural acumen and Capacitie: he had an ample vaſt ſoul, filled with Divine <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Heats:</hi> he was indeed the Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the ancient Faith in this point, and Doctor of Grace, being indeed an infatigable and invincible champion of <hi>Free-grace</hi> againſt <hi>Free-wil:</hi> He penetrated al the ſecrets of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,</hi> and opened their Vanitie: he entred by the conduct of Gods Spirit into the very bowels of corrupt Nature, and anatomiſed al its ſubtile Receſſes and Diverticules: He deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the darkneſſes of the blind mind, and diſcovered its venimous influences on human Acts: He alſo manifeſted the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſes and impotence of the corrupt Wil as to what is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good: He made a perfect Anatomie of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> diſſecting the ſmal fibres thereof. And this <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſie, which may wel be ſtiled the <hi>Hereſie of corrupt Nature, the daughter and mother of Pride,</hi> did but the more inflame his zele for Divine Grace, and increaſe his profound Humilitie: and whereas the pride of mans ſpirit takes great ſatisfaction in ſuch
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101821:85"/>fleſh-pleaſing notions, his incomparable Humilitie led him to a more implacable enmitie againſt them: and being fortified with the armor of Divine Light and Grace, he confounded the Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of <hi>Pelagianiſme,</hi> and Patrones of corrupt Free-wil, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their puerile ignorant Sophiſmes, and impudent Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; as alſo contemned their reproches and calumnies. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated his Hypotheſes with claritie, and demonſtrated them with invincible force, ſpecially in his two laſt pieces; thoſe he writ againſt the Semi-pelagians, <hi>of the Predeſtination of Saints, and of the gift of Perſeverance.</hi> We have an incomparable Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme of al his choifeſt ſentiments about Grace collected by that great Patrone of <hi>Free-Grace,</hi> and Impugnator of <hi>Free-wil, Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> in his <hi>Auguſtinus;</hi> where alſo we find an excellent account of <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Life, and Zele againſt the <hi>Pelagians:</hi> the like in <hi>Godeau, La Vie de St. Auguſtin.</hi> And becauſe ſome of late have thought <hi>Auguſtin</hi> too warme and paſſionate in his Zele againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> I ſhal give an abbreviate Idea or chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of his ſpirit and zele for God, which is more copioſely and lively delineated by <hi>Godeau,</hi> that great <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian, in the forementioned Hiſtorie of <hi>Auguſtin's Life. Auguſtin</hi> was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature for Parts, and a miracle of Grace for Pietie. It were eaſie to find admirable Parallels between thoſe two great men, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> which <hi>Godeau</hi> cals the ancient and new Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> obſerved in <hi>Paul</hi> an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fidelitie, a celeſte Eloquence, which was by ſo much the more capable to prevail, by how much the leſſe human. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo obſerved in him a ſingular adreſſe to manage Spirits, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable claritie to explicate Myſteries, a ſingular prudence to diſtribute Divine Verities according to the capacitie of his Diſciples, a marvellous judgement in his counſels, a profound intelligence to diſcover the ſecrets of mens hearts; a perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie for ſinners, and yet an amorous vehemence againſt Sin. <hi>Libertines</hi> were conſtrained to admire in <hi>Auguſtin</hi> an exemple, which they were not willing to imitate. He ſtudied more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pious than learned, and to purifie his heart from carnal Affections, than to enrich his Underſtanding with new Sciences. He thought he ought to grow in virtue according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he grew in dignitie. He was the Maſter of al by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Exemples; but by his Humilitie, charitable and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct, the Servant of al. The Son of God choſe him to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101821:86"/>defend the principal foundation of Chriſtian Religion. Other Doctors had particular lights for the defending diverſe Truths, but he had extraordinarie claritie for the defenſe of the prime Truth and Grace. If it be the nature of Science to puſſe up, then one might think ſuch an eminent Science as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> had ſhould greatly puffe him up; but the malignitie of Science was never ſo perfectly extinguiſhed as in him: and he is yet more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable for the profunditie of his Humilitie, than for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitie of his Doctrine: he ſearched not for the praiſe of men. We might copie out al <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Books, if we would report al the humble Sentiments which he hath couched touching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in a manner that is not affected, and wherein one cannot accuſe him, that he ſearched for Glorie in a ſeeming contemt thereof; he had no difficultie to confeſſe his ignorance in many things, which men believed he could inſtruct others in. He thus ſpeakes: <hi>I profeſſe I am of the number of thoſe which write in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting, and profit in writing.</hi> With what Sentiments of grief, with what ſinceritie, with what ſimplicitie, with what diligence, with what confuſion doth he in his Confeſſions ſpeak of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his ſpirit, of his fooliſh imaginations, of his extravagant thoughts of Divine Verities? with what freedome doth he open his heart, that we may read al the diſorders of his paſſions? we may cal theſe Confeſſions of his the triumph of Grace. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> had in his houſe an Aſſemblie of Miniſters with whom he lived in commun; he forgat nothing to bring them to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he had for al a love truly Paternal: he counſelled them in their douts, ſupported them in their infirmities, fortified them in their ſeebleſſes, accommodated himſelf to their ignorances. He had a great natural tenderneſſe of love towards his friends, which Grace formed into a Divine love.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> when <hi>Pelagianiſme,</hi> by the growth of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſme was come to a perfect ſtature, God raiſed up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Reformers, ſpecially <hi>Bradwardine</hi> and <hi>Wiclef,</hi> to oppoſe the ſame.<note place="margin">The Janſeniſtes Zele againſt Pelagianiſme.</note> Many alſo among the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minenſis, Alvarez,</hi> &amp;c. have put forth great efforts to pul down this Idol of <hi>Pelagianiſme.</hi> But none have been more bold and ſucceſſeful in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, for the overthrowing this proud <hi>Pelagian</hi> Idol, than pious and great <hi>Corn.

But to run up this <hi>Canonic Theologie</hi> to its origine or ſpring head, we no way dout but to make it very evident, that the main, if not the whole of Antichriſt's <hi>Eccleſiaſtic Canons</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> owes its origine to <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Philoſophic Inſtitutes.</hi> This we ſhal make good both by <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Human Autoritie.</hi> And the great hinge on which this our Demonſtration ſhal turne,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101821:95"/>is that eminent Prophetic image or character of Antichriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. compared with <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>ſuperſtition and tyrannic Impoſitions.</hi> For it is uſual with the Spirit of God in Scripture to paint forth and decipher the great and famoſe Apoſtaſie under Antichriſt, by leſſer and more particular Uſurpations and Apoſtaſies of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in thoſe times wherein the Propheſie was delivered. So in the Old Teſtament, what is Hiſtorically ſpoken of <hi>Egypt, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Antiochus, &amp;c.</hi> is in the New Teſtament applied to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and his Kingdome; in like manner as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> are made Types of Chriſt.

No, it is our ſafeſt courſe to interpret Scripture in its lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſenſe: for as it has been wel obſerved by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> in his <hi>Advancement of Learning, Prophetic Scriptures have their fulfilling over and again in diverſe Periods and Ages:</hi> ſo that al theſe Scriptures which we have before made uſe of to <hi>characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe</hi> and <hi>deſcribe</hi> the <hi>Gnoſtics</hi> and their <hi>Philoſophic Infuſions,</hi> who were the Forerunners of Antichriſt, may much more truely and fully be applied to Antichriſt, the great Antitype; who though laſt in Execution, yet was firſt in Intention, as we need no way dout. Having given this key, we ſhal procede to demonſtrate, <hi>That Antichriſts Canonic Theologie, or Eccleſiaſtic Canons,</hi> were <hi>Derivations</hi> from, and <hi>Imitamens</hi> of <hi>Philoſophic,</hi> and principally <hi>Pythagoric Inſtitutes.</hi> And herein we ſhal follow our wonted method, reducing the whole of our Demonſtration to the <hi>Forme</hi> and <hi>Mater</hi> of <hi>Canonic Theologie.</hi>
